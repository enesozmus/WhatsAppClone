In this series, we're going to be diving deep into building a WhatsApp iOS clone using SwiftUI, Firebase, and StreamSDK. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with iOS development or an experienced developer looking to expand your skills, this series has something for everyone!


While it is borderline impossible to create a 100% clone of any complex application, especially one that was built and is maintained by dozens of Software Engineers, in this WhatsApp clone Series we are going to attempt to cover 90% of the big client side functionalities.

From Swift to JavaScript, we are going to build our own modules and leverage 3rd party APIs only where appropriate. 

Write our own firebase cloud functions and security rules and talk about system designs and edge cases to look out for when building a WhatsApp like application.

We are also going to blend SwiftUI with UIKit and seamlessly animate components from both frameworks to nail a beautiful Message Reaction functionality.
